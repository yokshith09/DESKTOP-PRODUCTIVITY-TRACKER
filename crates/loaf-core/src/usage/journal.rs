//! Crash-safe time tracking (migration 011).
//!
//! The stretch in front right now lives in the tracker's memory and is written when it ends. If
//! Loaf is killed, Windows crashes or the power goes, that stretch used to vanish. So every look
//! (about a minute) the collector also *checkpoints* it here: one row per kind (`app`, `site`)
//! holding what is in front, when it started and when it was last seen. At the next start
//! [`UsageService::recover_open`] turns each row into a normal session that ends at `last_seen`
//! and clears the table.
//!
//! * The most that can be lost is the time since the last checkpoint (one look), which is the
//!   physical limit: a power cut cannot be saved from.
//! * Recovery never invents time: a stretch ends at the last time it was actually seen, never at
//!   the moment of recovery, so a night off does not turn into a night of work.
//! * Recovery never double-counts: a stretch that was also written normally (same name and same
//!   start) is skipped.
//! * Recovery goes through the same checks as any session (minimum, 12 h cap, not in the future,
//!   untracked sites refused).
//! * Deleting usage data, forgetting a site and "delete everything" all clear the journal, so
//!   nothing deleted can come back.
