# Pluto

**Small companion. Big universe.**

A lightweight, local-first desktop companion for Windows and macOS: notes, tasks, meetings and an automatic daily work log, with a desktop pet that lives alongside your work.

**Where things stand:** [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](PROJECT_STATUS.md) (evidence, defects, next actions) · [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) (milestones) · [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) · [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Start with the status file.

**Status:** 🔒 **D0–D7 locked** (2026-10-03). The app is built and running in CI on Windows and macOS: core logic, notes, tasks, reminders, time tracking and the dashboard exist. **Active work (2026-10-23): FM-V2 fix pack + companion features, per [`MASTER_PLAN.md`](MASTER_PLAN.md).** M1-M3 are code-complete; the owner reports they work in v2.0.0 (written test results still pending). See [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for what works, what is unverified and what is missing.

## Non-negotiables
Event-driven (no polling) · Idle CPU <1% · RAM <100 MB · Local-first SQLite · Pet present from v1 · Windows + macOS parity

## Decision log
| Date | Decision |
|------|----------|
| 2026-10-03 | PRD §9 decisions **D-1 … D-10 approved**; D2–D7 locked |
| 2026-10-03 | **ADR-014** accepted, then **superseded by ADR-017** — global search removed (no FTS5, overlay, or V-4) |
| 2026-10-03 | **ADR-018** — V-2 (RAM) measured early on CI runners in F0-02 |
| 2026-10-03 | **D0-A2 / ADR-015** — owner set phase order: Pet 3 → Developer 4 → MCP 5 (+ client scaffold, OAuth) → Voice 6 → Characters 7 |
| 2026-10-03 | **D0-A3 / ADR-016** — CI status built after MCP as Phase 5.1; Phase 4 is local git/build only and offline |
| 2026-10-03 | **D6-A1** — four schema corrections (migration transaction ownership, no `DELETED` task event, Unicode label folding, ADR-014 reference) |

A full account of the consistency review that preceded the lock is in
[`docs/01-build-principles/README.md`](docs/01-build-principles/README.md#cross-document-consistency-review-2026-10-03).

## Open before CP1 starts
Nothing blocking. The first unresolved questions are the Phase 0 verification
tasks **V-1 … V-5** (`docs/01-build-principles/07-architecture-decisions.md`),
measured in `F0-01` and `F0-12`. **V-2 (total RAM <100 MB)** is the one that can
force a new ADR before CP2.

## Milestones
`D0–D7 docs` → **CP1** Foundation + verification → CP2 Notes → CP3 Tasks + Daily Log → CP4 Meetings, Pet, Today → **CP5 v1.0.0** → M3 Capture/privacy → M4 Quick Actions → M5 Writing assistant → M6 Pet (cont.) → M7 Meeting-to-action → M8 Focus & wellbeing → M9 Voice → M10 MCP → M11 Privacy-radar report → M12 Developer → M13 Characters

Full detail and current status: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) (redesigned 2026-10-13 around the owner's new feature list; this is just the one-line chain).
