# FEATURE_ROADMAP — canonical feature and release roadmap

**Audited:** 2026-10-19 on `main` @ `8368daa`. Owner-reported release: **`v2.0.0`** (tag at `4bad6a2`, installed and tested by the owner); source version is still 0.2.0 (see §2 finding 10). Unsigned; **signing on hold** (owner, 2026-10-19) · **Product name:** undecided — "Loaf" is a working name in code and docs; nothing here renames it (see §13, D-NAME).

> **How this file relates to the others (no duplicate sources of truth).** Milestone M0–M13 *delivery order* stays in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). *Current state* stays in [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](PROJECT_STATUS.md). *Decisions* stay in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md). User-visible history stays in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). This file adds what those do not hold: the **complete requested-feature inventory** (FR-01…FR-39), a milestone plan for the features ROADMAP.md does not cover (FM-0…FM-12), the test matrix, traceability, release gates and the documentation protocol. Per-feature 13-point specs live in [`docs/features/FR-requested-features.md`](docs/features/FR-requested-features.md); older specs: [`docs/features/README.md`](docs/features/README.md), [`AN-assistant-notifications.md`](docs/features/AN-assistant-notifications.md). Product/design sources: [PRD](docs/02-prd/PRD.md) · [TRD](docs/03-trd/TRD.md) · [UI/UX brief](docs/04-design/ui-ux-brief.md) · [App flow](docs/04-design/app-flow.md) · [Schema](docs/05-backend/backend-schema.md) · [Implementation plan](docs/06-plan/implementation-plan.md).

> **Conflict to resolve before anyone starts FM-3 or later:** the owner's recorded order after M3 is Quick Actions → Writing → Reminders/pet → Meeting-to-action → Focus → Voice → MCP → Privacy report → Developer → Character ([`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)). Project Spaces, Credentials, Community and Computer Use are **not in that order at all**. The FM-order below is a *proposal*; `ROADMAP.md` stays authoritative until the owner approves a merge of the two (D-ORDER).

## 1. Product scope

**Owner instructions, 2026-10-19 (binding for this document):** (a) keep every existing feature and add the requested ones; (b) all application keyboard shortcuts are **off by default** and users enable them, with an enable/disable button (FR-37); (c) keep one Git branch (`main`) and remove the others; (d) code signing on hold; (e) the Meetings feature does not make sense to the owner and needs redesign, to be done in a later phase (FR-38); (f) for now, only the feature document and current-state documentation are in scope: **no feature code is built yet**.

Loaf is a local-first Windows/macOS desktop pet and productivity companion (Tauri v2 shell, Rust core `crates/loaf-core`, React/TypeScript UI). Non-negotiables already locked: local-first SQLite, no browser extension, event-driven (idle CPU <1%, RAM <100 MB), one feature at a time, tests with every change. Features that need a server, secrets, cloud AI or OS control change those assumptions and are marked **Blocked** until the owner decides (§13).

## 2. Current-state audit (evidence, not documentation)

Checks run 2026-10-19 on `4bad6a2`:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test --workspace` | **376 passed, 0 failed** (PROJECT_STATUS still says 347 — stale) |
| `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint` | clean |
| `pnpm test` | **111 passed, 18 files** (PROJECT_STATUS says 70/41/327 in places — stale) |
| `pnpm e2e`, release build, macOS run | **not run here** — need Windows/CI/Mac |

Audit findings (each tagged):

1. **[Certain]** Implemented in code: notes, tasks, links, labels, meetings, calendar, reminders, bin, daily log, settings, tray, autostart, shortcuts, pet window, app/website usage collectors, tab reader, known-tracker flag, privacy radar panel, data export/import/delete, DB backups.
2. **[Certain]** Absent from code: projects, focus/Pomodoro, any HTTP client or network call, AI provider, keychain/credentials, updater plugin, image/photo import, QR, git reading, accounts/backend, telemetry, referral logic, character packs. Plugins present: single-instance, notification, opener, autostart, dialog, global-shortcut, window-state.
3. **[Certain]** Dashboard tiles reorder (dnd-kit) and persist order (`ui.overview_order`); tile **spans are constants, so no resize and no auto-layout** exist (`MovableTiles.tsx`).
4. **[Certain]** Releases are unsigned (`release.yml`); no updater exists, so FR-36 cannot be met by configuration alone.
5. **[Likely]** Order survival on minimise/restore is already true because order is stored, but no test proves it (FR-23).
6. **[Likely]** Browser time may be shown in both apps and websites lists; not verified (FR-24).
7. **[Certain]** Every OS-facing feature is Unverified; Windows is checked only by the owner and e2e; macOS only by CI. Parity gaps: PROJECT_STATUS §4.8.
8. **[Certain]** Documentation drift: PROJECT_STATUS §1/§4 counts, §3 "active milestone", §4.5 version; `CLAUDE.md` still says active milestone M1; R6 says F0 specs are DRAFT. Counts are corrected in this change; milestone wording needs the owner (D-ORDER).
10. **[Certain]** Owner-reported `v2.0.0` tag points at `4bad6a2`, the same commit as `v0.2.0`, whose source version is 0.2.0. So the owner's installed build reports a version that differs from the tag name, unless the owner built with a different version. Decision needed (D-VERSION): bump source to 2.0.0 in one change, or keep 0.2.0 and treat the tag as a label.
11. **[Certain]** Global shortcuts are registered at startup with no master switch (`src-tauri/src/shortcuts.rs`; only `shortcuts.global_open` and `shortcuts.global_new_note` are configurable). They are therefore **on by default**, which conflicts with the owner's instruction (FR-37).
12. **[Certain]** Meetings is built (F1-17…19: `src/features/meetings`, `crates/loaf-core/src/meetings.rs`). The owner says the flow does not make sense; no defect list has been given yet (FR-38 needs one).
13. **[Likely]** About 18 of the 36 requested features have no precursor in the code at all; about 10 conflict with locked decisions or need a server/secrets (Blocked).

**Verified existing (Unverified on real OS, tests pass):** FR-19 tracking, ROADMAP M1–M3 features. **Partial:** FR-01, FR-20, FR-22, FR-27. Everything else: Planned or Blocked. Nothing is "Complete" on a real OS.

**Technical requirements (proposed, not requested):**

| ID | Requirement | Evidence | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|
| TR-01 | Code signing (Windows Authenticode, macOS notarisation) | `release.yml` unsigned | FM-2 |
| TR-02 | Migration safety: backup before migrate, additive migrations 004+ | `db.rs`, migrations 001–003 | every data milestone |
| TR-03 | Core must stay OS/tauri-free | `pnpm check:core-deps` | all |
| TR-04 | Accessibility: keyboard + labels for all new UI | dnd-kit keyboard sensor exists | all UI |
| TR-05 | Performance budget: idle CPU <1%, RAM <100 MB | `v2-ram.yml` | all |
| TR-06 | Secrets canary test (no secret in DB/log/export) | none | FM-6 |
| TR-07 | Network egress policy: allow-list + test that default build makes no non-loopback calls | no network code today | FM-5 |
| TR-08 | Threat models before FR-04, FR-13, FR-29, FR-30 | none | before those milestones |

## 4. Release scope and phases

**Order decided by the owner, 2026-10-21:** (1) fix the V2 issues the owner will list; (2) define and complete **all local features and characters**; (3) only then cloud and AI integration (FM-9 to FM-12 move after local completion). Cloud-dependent features stay Blocked until then.

| Phase | Goal | Milestones | Exclusions | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A Stabilise | 0.2.0 verified, dashboard correct, safe updates | FM-0, FM-1, FM-2 | New features | Windows checklist passes; signed build; updater test |
| B Productivity core | Projects, focus, local AI | FM-3, FM-4, FM-5 | Server, cloud | Each feature Complete on Windows |
| C Secure & utilities | Credentials, QR, git, triage | FM-6, FM-7 | Server | Secrets canary test green; Win+Mac checks |
| D Character | Look, photos, packs | FM-8 | Online gallery | Hostile-pack tests green |
| E Network | Backend, telemetry, community, cloud AI, computer use | FM-9…FM-12 | — | **Owner approval of backend and safety design first** |

Dependency map: FM-0 → FM-1 → FM-2; FM-3 → FM-4, FM-8(project-aware), FM-6; FM-5 → FM-11 → FM-12; FM-9 → FM-10; FM-6 → FM-11.

## 5. Milestones

One milestone is active at a time: **FM-0**. Effort: S ≤1 day · M 2–4 · L 1–2 weeks · XL >2 weeks (single developer + Claude; assumes owner answers decisions within a day and tests on Windows).

### FM-0 — Verify 0.2.0 and reconcile docs  **[ACTIVE]**
- **Goal / value:** know what really works before building more. · **Status:** In progress (owner has installed and tested `v2.0.0`; results not yet recorded here). · **Evidence:** 376 Rust + 111 frontend tests pass on `8368daa`; tag `v2.0.0` pushed by owner; source version mismatch (finding 10).
- **Features:** FR-19. · **Prerequisites:** owner PC. · **Effort:** S.
- **Tasks (ordered):** 1 owner sends test results for `v2.0.0` (`RELEASE_0.2.0_TEST.md` and the Windows checklist); 2 record them in PROJECT_STATUS §8; 3 decide D-VERSION; 4 fix defects; 5 reconcile ROADMAP active-milestone wording and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Tests:** T-19-01…03. · **Acceptance:** each checklist line has a recorded pass/fail; failures logged as risks. · **DoD:** docs updated; no unexecuted result claimed.
- **Risks:** R-owner-time. · **Next action:** owner runs the Windows checklist and reports results.

### FM-1 — Dashboard and Time-tab correctness
- **Goal / value:** layout does what a user expects. · **Status:** Planned. · **Evidence:** audit finding 3, 5, 6. · **Features:** FR-20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27. · **Prereq:** FM-0 · **Effort:** L.
- **Tasks:** 1 FR-23 regression tests; 2 FR-24 audit + test; 3 FR-22 layout pref + resize + auto-layout; 4 FR-25 repro from owner screenshot; 5 FR-20 heatmap; 6 FR-27 shutdown test.
- **Affected:** `src/features/overview`, `time`, `charts`, `ipc/settings.ts`, `mock.ts`. · **Tests:** T-20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27. · **Acceptance:** per spec. · **DoD:** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` green, Windows visual check, docs.
- **Risks:** FR-25 undefined without screenshot. · **Next action:** write FR-23 order-stability test in `src/features/overview`.

### FM-2 — Signed releases, updater, release notes
- **Features:** FR-35, FR-36, TR-01. · **Status:** Blocked — **code signing on hold** by owner (2026-10-19). Updater design may still be written; nothing signed ships until the owner lifts the hold. · **Prereq:** FM-0 · **Effort:** XL.
- **Tasks:** 1 owner orders certificates; 2 updater signing keys; 3 add `tauri-plugin-updater`; 4 What's-new dialog; 5 tampered-artifact and interrupted-update tests; 6 rollback doc.
- **Tests:** T-35, T-36. · **Acceptance:** tampered artifact rejected; previous version recoverable. · **Risks:** cert lead time; SmartScreen reputation. · **Next action:** owner orders signing certificates.

### FM-3 — Project Spaces and project tools
- **Features:** FR-06, 09, 11, 14. · **Status:** Planned (decision U-new-4, ordering D-ORDER). · **Prereq:** FM-0, owner approval · **Effort:** XL.
- **Tasks:** migration 004 (+backup test) → core service → link notes/tasks/links → UI → launcher → student type → setup checklist.
- **Tests:** T-06, 09, 11, 14. · **Acceptance:** existing data intact after migration; no shell execution. · **Risks:** data-model creep. · **Next action:** owner picks project types (student/developer/personal) and approves schema sketch.

### FM-4 — Focus, Pomodoro, Tab Tantrum, full-screen
- **Features:** FR-05, 08, 26. · **Status:** Planned; FR-08 Blocked on accuracy decision. · **Prereq:** FM-3 (project link) · **Effort:** L.
- **Tasks:** focus migration → scheduler events → UI → pet states → per-OS full-screen spike → Tab Tantrum decision.
- **Tests:** T-05, 08, 26. · **Risks:** full-screen behaviour differs per OS; Windows tab count partial. · **Next action:** per-OS full-screen spike write-up.

### FM-5 — Local AI and AI tools
- **Features:** FR-28, 07, 12, 15, 16. · **Status:** Blocked on U12. · **Prereq:** D-AI · **Effort:** XL.
- **Tasks:** resolve U12 → provider trait → Ollama client → rules-first error translator → prompt improvement → study quiz → practice timer.
- **Tests:** T-28, 07, 12, 15, 16, TR-07 egress test. · **Risks:** model quality/RAM. · **Next action:** owner answers U12.

### FM-6 — Secure Credential Access
- **Features:** FR-13. · **Status:** Planned; threat model first. · **Prereq:** FM-3 · **Effort:** XL.
- **Tasks:** threat model → reference table → keychain trait (Win/Mac) → clipboard clear → env template → rotation reminders → canary test.
- **Tests:** T-13 (canary). · **Acceptance:** no secret in SQLite/logs/export. · **Risks:** highest-security feature; macOS verification needs a Mac. · **Next action:** write the threat model.

### FM-7 — Desktop utilities
- **Features:** FR-17, 18, 21. · **Status:** Planned. · **Prereq:** FM-1 (heatmap for commits) · **Effort:** XL.
- **Tests:** T-17, 18, 21. · **Risks:** permission prompts, OS notification APIs. · **Next action:** decoder spike with QR fixtures.

### FM-8 — Character
- **Features:** FR-01, 02, 03. · **Status:** Planned (ROADMAP M13). · **Prereq:** FM-3 for project-aware · **Effort:** XL.
- **Tests:** T-01, 02, 03 (zip-slip, EXIF). · **Risks:** untrusted files. · **Next action:** owner picks supported image formats.

### FM-9 — Backend foundation, telemetry, website
- **Features:** FR-32, 34. · **Status:** Blocked (D-BACKEND, D-NAME). · **Effort:** XL. · **Next action:** owner decides whether any server may exist.

### FM-10 — Community, referrals, groups
- **Features:** FR-04, 10, 31, 33. · **Status:** Blocked. · **Prereq:** FM-9, FR-03 · **Effort:** XL. · **Next action:** none until D-BACKEND.

### FM-11 — Cloud AI fallback

### FM-13 — Meetings redesign (deferred, later phase)
- **Features:** FR-38. · **Status:** Planned, deferred by owner. · **Prereq:** owner description of what does not work. · **Effort:** M (unknown until described).
- **Next action:** owner lists the parts of Meetings that do not make sense.

### FM-12 — Computer-Use Assistant
- **Features:** FR-30. · **Status:** Blocked (D-COMPUTER, TR-08). · **Effort:** XL.

(Fields not repeated for FM-9…FM-12 — goals, tests, acceptance and risks — are in the FR specs; they are not startable, so no further planning is committed.)

## 6. Test matrix

Commands are the repo's real ones: `cargo test --workspace`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`, `pnpm e2e` (Windows, `e2e.yml`), manual = owner checklist. "Not run" means written but not executed; nothing marked missing has been run.

FR-37 and FR-38 come from the owner's 2026-10-19 instructions (shortcut master switch; Meetings redesign). Inventory §1 numbering: 1 Companion · 2 Productivity · 3 Student & developer · 4 Utilities · 5 AI · 8 Community · 9 Distribution. Item 6 (Project Spaces) = FR-06/09/11/14; item 7 (Credentials) = FR-13; item 10 (naming) = D-NAME.

## 8. Release gates

| Gate | Condition |
|---|---|
| G-test | `cargo test --workspace`, `pnpm test`, typecheck, lint green on the release commit; coverage floors met |
| G-win | Owner Windows checklist recorded |
| G-mac | Mac checklist recorded, else the release says "macOS untested" |
| G-sign | Signed artifacts (FM-2) before any public (non-test) release |
| G-sec | Secrets canary + egress tests green before FM-6 / FM-5 ship |
| G-docs | Documentation protocol (§11) satisfied |

## 9. Risks and blockers

| ID | Risk / blocker | Effect | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| RB-1 | Backend features conflict with local-first | FR-04, 10, 31, 32, 33, 34 cannot start | Owner decision D-BACKEND |
| RB-2 | No signing certificates | No safe updater (FR-36) | Owner orders certs |
| RB-3 | No Mac available | Mac features stay Unverified | Say so in release notes |
| RB-4 | Tag push blocked in this session | Owner pushes the tag | Commands given to owner |
| RB-5 | Scope: 36 features, one developer | Slips | One active milestone; Blocked items not planned |
| RB-6 | Existing R1–R11 | See PROJECT_STATUS §6 | — |

## 10. Current Focus

**Active milestone: FM-0** (verification of `v2.0.0`). **Mode: documentation only** (owner, 2026-10-19). Blockers: owner's test results for v2.0.0; D-SHORTCUT-DEFAULT upgrade detail. **Single next task:** owner sends the `v2.0.0` test results; Claude then records them in PROJECT_STATUS §8 and drafts FR-37 and FR-38 for owner approval. Update this section after every task.

## 11. Documentation update protocol (mandatory)

After **each feature, milestone and phase**: (1) update the feature spec and tick its checklist; (2) update status here and in `ROADMAP.md`; (3) update `PROJECT_STATUS.md`; (4) add a user-facing line to `CHANGELOG.md`; (5) update affected TRD / schema / app-flow docs; (6) record test results (command, date, count); (7) update §10 Current Focus. **Never** mark work Complete while tests, acceptance criteria or docs are outstanding; **never** state OS behaviour or test results that were not executed; **never** delete, reset, overwrite or discard user work — migrations are additive and preceded by a backup.

## 12. Technical-choice notes

Prefer existing plugins and crates over new dependencies; `keyring` crate for FR-13, `tauri-plugin-updater` for FR-36, local `git` for FR-21, Ollama over bundled models. Each is a proposal until its milestone starts.

## 13. Unresolved decisions (owner)

| ID | Decision | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| D-NAME | Final product name (stays undecided; no renames) | FR-34 |
| D-UPLOAD | **Decided 2026-10-21: allowed.** Consent text and local-first processing required (FR-02, FR-39) | closed |
| D-FORMAT | **Approved 2026-10-21 as a starting point**; format to be found by trial and error (FR-39) | open (iterative) |
| D-RIVE | **Decided 2026-10-21: run the one-character Rive trial** (FR-39 §3.3) | open (trial) |
| D-CHARS | **Decided 2026-10-21: owner supplies reference images; Claude designs the built-in characters** | open (inputs) |
| D-VERSION | **Decided 2026-10-19: keep source version 0.2.0** (owner: "leave it"). Tag `v2.0.0` stays as the owner's label | closed |
| D-SHORTCUT-DEFAULT | **Owner, 2026-10-19: off by default "in the coming versions".** Open detail: does this also apply to existing installs on upgrade? | FR-37 |
| D-MEETINGS | **Owner will define it. Owner asked to be asked about it next time Meetings comes up.** Do not start | FR-38 (later phase) |
| D-ORDER | Merge FM-order with the owner's ROADMAP order; where Project Spaces goes | FM-3+ |
| D-BACKEND | May any server exist (accounts, telemetry, referrals, gallery)? | FM-9, 10 |
| D-AI | U12 provider; Ollama as the local default | FM-5 |
| D-CLOUD | Cloud fallback at all? default off | FM-11 |
| D-COMPUTER | Is a computer-use assistant in scope and with what permission model | FM-12 |
| D-CRED | Keychain-only credential policy | FM-6 |
| D-TANTRUM | Tab Tantrum accuracy on Windows without extension | FR-08 |
| D-TYPES | Project types and unit of "project" | FM-3 |
| existing | U13, U16 (provisional), U18, U19, U21–U23 in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) | various |
