# Loaf — Roadmap
> **Start here: [`MASTER_PLAN.md`](MASTER_PLAN.md)** — phases, milestones, every feature with its "done when" (2026-10-22).
>
> Requested-feature inventory, extra milestones (FM-x), test matrix and release gates: [`FEATURE_ROADMAP.md`](FEATURE_ROADMAP.md). Delivery order for M0–M13 stays in this file.

The one page that tracks progress. Flow: **build principles → phases → milestones → features.**
Everything else is reference — open it when a feature needs it:

| Need | Document |
|------|----------|
| Where things stand, evidence, defects | [PROJECT_STATUS](PROJECT_STATUS.md) |
| Why things were decided, open questions | [DECISIONS](DECISIONS.md) |
| What changed | [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) |
| Why / what the product is | [Product Document](docs/00-product/product-document.md) · [PRD](docs/02-prd/PRD.md) |
| How it is built | [TRD](docs/03-trd/TRD.md) · [Schema](docs/05-backend/backend-schema.md) · [ADRs](docs/01-build-principles/07-architecture-decisions.md) |
| What it looks like | [App flow](docs/04-design/app-flow.md) · [UI/UX brief](docs/04-design/ui-ux-brief.md) |
| Feature detail (acceptance, tests) | [`docs/features/`](docs/features/README.md) |
| Sizes and exit gates | [Implementation plan](docs/06-plan/implementation-plan.md) |

**Rule from here:** this file tracks plan and status. Evidence for every status is in [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](PROJECT_STATUS.md). Scope or design changes are one line in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md); a locked document is amended only if it would otherwise contradict the code.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-23 — FR-106…FR-109 task upgrades built (Unverified); FR-110 focus timer by the pet next; student-pack and now-strip (FR-88) previews published for owner review (P2, not built); all notifications now show above the pet only (toast stack removed); new-feature building paused until the remaining FM-V2 fixes (FR-43 edges, FR-44, FR-45, FR-46, FR-48, FR-62 findable) are done and a draft release goes out; building FM-V2 (done: FR-41, FR-42, FR-47, FR-52, FR-61, FR-63 slice, FR-85, FR-90, FR-92-94, FR-96, pet-visibility fixes, FR-104; see MASTER_PLAN); all sprite-pack rows drawn (FR-50, Unverified); student-first delivery order approved and V2 milestones added (see "Delivery order"); earlier: 2026-10-13 — milestones M4 onward redesigned around the owner's 2026-10-13 feature list (Quick Actions, Writing/Prompt Assistant, Focus & Wellbeing, an expanded Privacy Radar) and renumbered; see §2 "Renumbering" and `DECISIONS.md` for what changed and what is still open (an AI-provider choice for M5, and whether Developer reactions — old M5, now M12 — is still wanted). Status words (Complete, Unverified, Partial, Planned…) are defined in PROJECT_STATUS §2. **Unverified** means it compiles and CI is green but nobody has run it on a real machine.

## 1. Build principles

Full text: [`docs/01-build-principles/`](docs/01-build-principles/README.md).

1. **Event-driven, always** — no polling; one-shot timers are fine.
2. **Lightweight, always** — idle CPU <1%, RAM <100 MB.
3. **Local-first** — user data lives in SQLite on their machine.
4. **One feature at a time** — finish and verify before the next.
5. **UI first** — design before backend.
6. **Tests early** — before or alongside code; >80% coverage to ship.
7. **Learn fundamentals first** — understand it before reaching for a library.
8. **Usable at every phase** — each phase ships something people can use.
9. **No premature optimisation** — make it work, right, then fast.
10. **Technical debt is a debt** — log it with a payoff date.

## 2. Milestones (release order)

The first release is **M1: Notes and daily work management (P0)**. Everything else waits for it. The PRD's "v1.0.0" (notes + tasks + meetings + pet) stays as the full Phase 1 target; M1 is the smaller release before it, labelled **v0.1.0** (owner, 2026-10-11).

| Milestone | Name | Contents | Status |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|
| **M0** | Foundation closure | Real-Windows run, autostart, export/import/delete, perf harness | 🟡 Partial |
| **M1** | **Notes + daily work (P0, first release, v0.1.0)** | Notes, tasks, search, labels, dates, completion history, daily progress, release gate | 🟡 Code complete; owner reports it works in v2.0.0 (written results pending). **Active work is now FM-V2 + companion (see Delivery order / MASTER_PLAN)** |
| M2 | Phase 1 completion → v1.0.0 | Meetings, pet window, global shortcuts, settings screens, first run | 🟡 code complete; signing blocked on the owner |
| M3 | Capture, browser tracking & privacy (Phase 2) | App/site time, extensions, macOS collector, open tabs, privacy-radar capture | 🟡 Feature-complete for the option-d scope; shipped as 0.2.0 for owner testing, **Unverified** on Windows and Mac |
| M4 | Universal Quick Actions | Keyboard-accessible command centre: notes, tasks, search, AI actions | ⬜ |
| M5 | Context-aware writing & prompt assistant | Message polishing, prompt generation/improvement, controlled refinement | ⬜ **blocked on an AI-provider decision (owner)** |
| M6 | Reminders & contextual pet, continued | Event-driven reactions to focus/app time, quiet hours, settings | 🟡 base built in M1/M2 (reminders, pet, task/reminder reactions); this finishes it |
| M7 | Meeting-to-action, AI-assisted | Auto-summary and suggested decisions/action items; audio recording later | 🟡 manual version built in M2 (F1-17…19); the AI parts need M5's provider interface |
| M8 | Focus & digital wellbeing | Focus timers, task-linked sessions, daily/weekly summaries, goals | ⬜ |
| M9 | Voice commands & dictation (Phase 6) | STT benchmark, push-to-talk, voice → task/note/search | ⬜ |
| M10 | MCP connectors (Phase 5, 5.1) | One verified connector first, then GitHub, Calendar, Gmail, Slack, Notion, CI status | ⬜ |
| M11 | Privacy radar: the report | Evidence-based tracker report with uncertainty shown, not claims | 🟡 the option-d panel shipped with M3 (0.2.0 work); M11 is only what remains: per-site don't-track/delete actions and a richer report |
| M12 | Developer reactions (Phase 4) | Git and local build awareness | ⬜ **not in the owner's 2026-10-13 list — confirm still wanted** |
| M13 | Character customization (Phase 7) | 18 characters, outfits | 🟡 4 characters + the bear's typing pose pulled forward |

**Renumbering (2026-10-13):** everything from old M4 onward was never started, so renumbering it is free. Old **M4 Desktop companion** → **M6**; old **M5 Developer** → **M12**; old **M6 MCP** → **M10**; old **M6b CI status** → **M10b**; old **M7 Voice** → **M9**; old **M8 Character** → **M13**. New: **M4 Quick Actions**, **M5 Writing/Prompt assistant**, **M7 Meeting-to-action (AI)**, **M8 Focus & wellbeing**, **M11 Privacy radar report**.

### Delivery order (student-first, approved 2026-10-22)

M-ids are unchanged; this is the order we build in. Specs for the new rows are in `docs/features/FR-v2-features.md`.

| Order | Milestone | What | Notes |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| 1 | M1 / M2 gates | Windows verification of v2.0.0 | Owner-side; blocks nothing below but nothing is "Complete" without it |
| 2 | **FM-V2** V2 fix pack | FR-41..FR-48, FR-52, FR-61, FR-49a: toasts, actionable links, pet pop-ups fixed, resizable Time tiles, date/time picker, auto-delete, remove Logs, pet shortcuts, rename links, browser tabs spike | All questions answered |
| 3 | **FM-ST** Student pack | FR-58 plus FR-52: course label, focus linked to a task, weekly report, exam countdown, quick capture, meeting action items on Today | Quiz from notes waits for AI |
| 4 | **FM-GUIDE** Guide | FR-51: tour, Guide page, "Built by QUORBIT TECHNOLOGIES" | Skippable |
| 5 | **FM-CS** Character Studio and sprite packs | FR-49, FR-50: accessories, pack format, Studio | Personal photos on HOLD |
| 6 | M8 Focus and wellbeing | Timers, summaries, goals | Builds on the student pack |
| 7 | **FM-PS** Project Spaces (opt-in, off by default) | FR-53 | Shared by students and developers |
| 8 | M12 Developer reactions | Git and build awareness, CI status | Confirmed by the owner |
| 9 | **FM-INT** Local MCP server | FR-54 | Local only; D-MCP-SHAPE open |
| 10 | **FM-LIN** Linux build | FR-57 | Unverified until run on Linux |
| 11 | **FM-BE** Backend and gallery, **FM-PLUG** plugins | FR-56, FR-55 | Needs the privacy statement; code signing on HOLD |
| 12 | M4, M5, M7, M9, M10, M11, M13 | As in the table above | M5 blocked on the AI provider |

**Order after M3 before 2026-10-22 (superseded by the table above), per the owner's 2026-10-13 feature list:** Quick Actions → Writing assistant → Reminders/pet (finish) → Meeting-to-action (AI) → Focus & wellbeing → Voice → MCP → Privacy radar report → Developer → Character. This **supersedes part of ADR-015** (which had Developer → MCP → Voice): Voice now comes before MCP, and Developer reactions wasn't in the new list at all. See `DECISIONS.md` — this is flagged for the owner to confirm, not silently assumed.

## M1 — Notes + daily work (P0, first release)

**Goal:** someone can capture notes, plan and finish tasks, find things, and see what they got done each day — on a real Windows machine, with their data safe. **Exit gate:** every checked item below, the Windows checklist (PROJECT_STATUS §8) passed, CI green on Windows and macOS, installer built.

### M1.1 Notes

- [x] T5 Delete a finished task

### M1.3 Daily progress
- [x] Daily log core: live, freeze, missed days (F1-15)
- [x] Done-this-week bars, Activity feed
- [x] D-a/D-b Daily log on the Time page: last 14 days, done of planned, change vs the day before, expand, copy as Markdown (F1-16)
- [x] D-c **dropped**: no Progress card (owner)

### M1.4 Release gate
- [ ] G1 Real-Windows checklist passed and recorded — **owner**
- [x] G2 Export / import / delete all data (F0-11) — built, Unverified
- [x] G3 Autostart (F0-09) — built, Unverified

- [x] G5 Time-of-day test bug fixed
- [x] G6 Coverage floors enforced in CI (core ≥ 90% lines, frontend thresholds)
- [x] Version bumped to 0.1.0; tag push builds installers and a draft release
- [ ] Install the draft release's installer on a clean PC and pass the checklist, then publish

**Already built and not part of the original M1 list (owner additions):** reminders with notifications, the Today overview dashboard with drag-to-reorder tiles, week calendar, Links, Time page and Windows app tracking. They ship with M1 but their real-machine behaviour is Unverified.

## M2 — Phase 1 completion → v1.0.0

| ID | Feature | Status |
|----|---------|--------|
| F1-17 | Meeting create/edit + participants | ✅ Built 2026-10-12 (core `meetings.rs`, Meetings page, autosave, participant suggestions, filters) |
| F1-18 | Decisions + action items | ✅ Built 2026-10-12 (add, edit, remove, reorder) |
| F1-19 | Action item → task | ✅ Built 2026-10-12 (task status shown live on the item) |
| F1-22 | Minimal pet window | 🟡 Built, Unverified (0.1.1, pulled forward by the owner after testing v0.1.0): hover card, click/double-click/right-click, drag, saved spot. 0.1.2 adds the soft-3D bear and task/reminder reactions with bubbles. Missing: reactions to focus/app time |
| F1-23 | Today view (R1-70 rest) | ✅ 2026-10-12: one line "Yesterday: X of Y done · N still open" that opens those tasks (owner chose only this; follow-ups and pinned notes dropped) |
| F1-24 | Global shortcuts + quick-add popup + keymap | ✅ 2026-10-12 (Unverified on Windows): `Mod+Shift+L/N` changeable in Settings, `Mod+Shift+P` fixed; quick-add popup and `Mod+Shift+T` dropped by the owner |
| F1-25 | Settings screens (Pet, Shortcuts, Advanced) | ✅ 2026-10-12: Shortcuts (change/reset), Data (database location, open folder), Advanced (log detail live, open logs folder, reset settings), About (open-source licenses) |
| F1-26 | First run + empty states | 🟡 Welcome screen built (2026-10-12): shown once on a fresh Loaf or after Delete all, never to someone with notes or tasks; three start actions (task, note, meeting); pet on, tracking and login off. |
| F1-27 | Cross-OS E2E, signing, **v1.0.0** | 🟡 E2E built 2026-10-12: Windows WebDriver run (welcome, task, note, meeting → task, restart) and macOS launch smoke test in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`; passes 3/3 locally on Linux. **Signing waits for the owner's certificates.** The release is after Phase 2 (owner) |

F1-20 and F1-21 (search) are cancelled; their numbers are retired.

## M3 — Browser tracking (Phase 2)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Windows foreground-app tracking, opt-in, domain-only (ADR-019) | 🟡 Built, **Unverified** on Windows |
| Per-app / per-site time, Time page, filters | ✅ Complete (UI-mock) |
| Website time from the address bar (Windows: UI Automation; Mac: AppleScript for Chrome/Edge/Brave/Vivaldi), `tracking.sites` | 🟡 Built 2026-10-12, **Unverified** on both |
| Open tabs, no extension | 🟡 Built 2026-10-13 (owner: the pet does it all with granted permissions). Windows: tab titles via UI Automation, domain for the showing tab only. macOS: every tab's domain via AppleScript (Chrome-family). Close a tab from the list. **Unverified** |
| Open-tabs list and close tab | 🟡 Built (see the row above), **Unverified** |
| Firefox, Safari | ⬜ Not built: no extension by decision; Safari/Firefox on macOS record nothing, Firefox on Windows untested |
| Known-tracker check for visited sites (U16 option d) | 🟡 Built 2026-10-18: core helper, `is_tracker` on each site, a "Known tracker" tag in the site list and a Privacy radar panel on Time › Sites (known-tracker sites, time on them, sites by category; wording says "not flagged", never "clean"). No third-party request tracking. Tests in Rust and the UI. **Unverified** on a real PC (needs real browsing) |
| Windows / macOS parity audit (2026-10-18) | 🟡 Done on paper; see PROJECT_STATUS §4.8. Real gaps: Safari/Firefox/Arc on Mac; Windows open-tab domains only for the showing tab; Windows private-window detection is English-only |
| macOS foreground-app collector | 🟡 Built 2026-10-12 (NSWorkspace, 1 s), **Unverified** on a Mac |

---

## Outline: Phase 2 remainder *(see M3)*
**Milestone 2.1 — Capture**
- App-focus tracking (OS events, no polling)
- ~~Chrome + Edge extensions (MV3), native-messaging bridge~~ — dropped 2026-10-13: open tabs and site time are both read directly, no extension (see DECISIONS.md)

**Milestone 2.2 — Data & privacy**
- Browser / domain sessions, buffered writes (≤1/min)
- Domain categories
- **Privacy radar capture — blocked on a design decision (DECISIONS U16):** the address bar only shows the page you are on, never the third-party requests that page makes (ad and tracker calls). Seeing those needs a browser extension (ruled out 2026-10-13), a system-level network watcher (Windows DNS event tracing needs administrator rights; nothing equivalent on macOS), or a local proxy. Flagging *visited* sites that are themselves known trackers is possible but nearly useless. Original wording kept below for reference. Privacy radar capture: known-tracker domains flagged on the same per-domain record used for `tracking.exclude_apps`-style do-not-track, incognito excluded, delete data. The report UI that explains this to the person, with evidence and uncertainty, is **M11** — item 9 on the owner's list, scheduled here only because it shares this milestone's browser-extension groundwork; if the owner wants the capture-and-report shipped together, say so and M11 folds back into M3.

**Milestone 2.3 — Dashboard**
- ~~Today dashboard: time by category, top apps and domains, hourly chart~~ — **built** (Today overview and Time page)
- ~~Open tabs view + close tab~~ — **built 2026-10-13**, see the table above
- ~~Today vs yesterday~~ — **built** ("23m less than yesterday" on Today)


## M4 — Universal Quick Actions *(outline)*

*Owner's feature 2. A keyboard-accessible command centre, reachable from anywhere on the desktop, not just inside the main window.*

**Milestone 4.1 — Invocation and shell**
- Global shortcut opens the command palette as its own small always-on-top window (same pattern as the pet window), so it works while another app has focus
- Fuzzy search over commands; recent and frequent commands ranked first
- Esc closes it; it never steals focus it doesn't need

**Milestone 4.2 — Core actions (no AI, ships first)**
- New note, new task (with the same quick-add parsing already in Today)
- Search notes and tasks from the palette, jump straight to the result
- Jump to a page (Today, Time, Notes, Meetings, Settings)

**Milestone 4.3 — AI actions**
- Depends on **M5**'s provider interface: "Polish this message," "Turn this into a prompt," "Summarize the clipboard"
- The palette shows AI actions only once a provider is configured (Settings), never a dead button
- Every AI action opens M5's review screen before anything is copied or sent; the palette never acts unreviewed

**Initial scope:** 4.1 and 4.2 only — a working command centre with zero cloud dependency. 4.3 is a thin front end once M5 exists; it is not blocked on M5 existing when M4 itself is built, only on it being *used*.

---

## M5 — Context-aware writing & prompt assistant *(outline)*

*Owner's feature 3, verbatim brief kept as the spec. This is the project's first feature that sends user text to an external AI provider — a deliberate exception to build principle 3 (local-first data in SQLite), scoped tightly: the text sent is whatever the person explicitly put in, nothing is stored remotely, and nothing leaves the device until the person asks for this specific action.*

**Blocked on one decision only the owner can make, before any code:** which AI provider (Claude via the Anthropic API is the natural default inside this stack; OpenAI or a local model are the alternatives), whether there's a free/local fallback for people without an API key, and how the key is stored (OS keychain, matching the pattern MCP will need anyway in M10). See `DECISIONS.md` §1.

### 5.1 — Writing foundation
- Shared UI: one interface, three modes (Polish Message / Generate Prompt / Improve Prompt)
- AI provider interface: one trait the UI calls, so the provider choice above is a plug-in, not a rewrite
- Draft preservation (the original text is never overwritten until the person accepts), copy, loading and error states
- Settings: provider, API key (OS keychain), a visible "this sends text to \<provider\>" notice — cloud use is never silent

### 5.2 — Message polishing
- Rewrite rough messages for WhatsApp, email, professional communication and other messaging platforms
- Tones: friendly, professional, polite, concise, confident
- Preserve intent and facts; never invent commitments, dates or excuses the person didn't write

### 5.3 — Prompt generation and improvement
- Rough idea → structured prompt, using the five-part framework (role/task, dynamic content, detailed instructions, optional examples, repeated critical instructions) — adapted to the task, so a simple request doesn't get an over-engineered prompt
- Prompt improvement: review an existing prompt for ambiguity, missing context, conflicting instructions, weak constraints, unclear output format; explain the problems, then generate the improved version
- Task-specific templates for ChatGPT/Claude-style chat prompts, coding-agent prompts and research prompts

### 5.4 — Context engineering
- Optional context box: paste in relevant text, a document, or (later) authorised project information
- Never invent missing information; if context materially changes the result and wasn't given, ask once — the spec's own rule
- Framework selection is automatic: the assistant picks structured prompting, few-shot examples, an output schema or a template based on the task, not a menu the person has to understand first

### 5.5 — Controlled refinement
- A bounded draft → review → refine → validate loop, with a defined success check and a maximum number of attempts (this is "loop engineering" from the spec — deterministic code owns the bound and the exit condition, the AI only drafts)
- Review/edit/copy/retry UI: the person always sees the draft before it goes anywhere, can edit it directly, ask for another version, or refine further
- Nothing is sent on the person's behalf (no auto-send to WhatsApp, no auto-paste into another app) in this milestone — see 5.6 for why that stays deferred

### 5.6 — Cross-application support
- Ships first inside: the Notes editor, and M4's Quick Actions palette
- Explicit-input workflow for text copied from WhatsApp, email, ChatGPT, Claude or anywhere else: paste in, get a result, copy out — the person stays in control of the send
- **Deferred, not in initial scope:** browser extensions for in-page rewriting, system-wide text selection/replacement. Both need platform APIs validated first (accessibility/selection hooks differ per OS and per app) and both would need their own permission story like M3's site reading; revisit after the explicit-input version proves useful

**Initial scope (owner's own list):** message polishing, prompt generation, prompt improvement, optional context, review/edit/copy, retry. **Explicitly deferred:** advanced repository retrieval, unrestricted autonomous loops, large framework libraries, system-wide text replacement.

**Success criterion (owner's words):** people can turn rough thoughts into polished messages or effective prompts directly from their workflow, with less context switching, without losing control of the final output.

---

## M6 — Reminders & contextual pet, continued *(outline)*

*Owner's feature 4. The reminder system and the pet already exist (M1, M2) and already react to task/reminder events. This milestone is what's left: reacting to the kind of events that need the usage-tracking and focus infrastructure from M3/M8, plus making the reaction rules configurable instead of hardcoded.*

**Milestone 6.1 — More triggers**
- React to a task left open past its deadline, not just a reminder firing (distinct from the dropped "overdue reaction," which fired on every overdue task on every event; this is a single, deliberate nudge)
- React to a finished focus session (depends on M8)
- React to unusually long unbroken app time, rate-limited so it nags at most once per stretch

**Milestone 6.2 — Quiet hours and configurability**
- A quiet-hours window in Settings and a manual quiet-mode switch on the pet: no sound, no taskbar flash, no OS toast inside it (notifications still log). Bubbles follow the rule per type: pet reactions are hidden; assistant-event bubbles still show (owner, 2026-10-18; amends this line — confirm, U20)
- Per-reaction-type on/off, reusing the pattern `pet.typing` already set: off by default for anything new, its own switch, explained in one line

**Milestone 6.4 — AI assistant notifications (owner request 2026-10-14)**
- Native notification when Claude Code finishes a task, needs input or fails, even while the owner works in another app. Hook → small helper → local pipe/socket → policy (dedupe, quiet hours, min turn length) → notifier. Plan, acceptance criteria and verification gate: [`docs/features/AN-assistant-notifications.md`](docs/features/AN-assistant-notifications.md) (AN-00…AN-09, ≈19 dev-days)
- Bubble above the pet is the primary channel (owner, 2026-10-18). **Not started.** AN-00 (a verification spike on a real Claude Code install) comes first and gates everything else; open questions U17–U22 in DECISIONS.md. Needs M6.2 quiet hours (built once, shared). Other assistants only after AN-00-style verification of their mechanism (AN-09).

**Milestone 6.3 — Already built, verify only**
- Task/reminder reactions with bubbles (M2), typing-along (M2), text-box waiting (M2) — these need a real-OS pass (PROJECT_STATUS §7), not new code

---

## M7 — Meeting-to-action, AI-assisted *(outline)*

*Owner's feature 7. The manual version — create/edit a meeting, add decisions and action items by hand, convert one to a task — is built (M2, F1-17…19). This milestone is the AI layer on top.*

**Milestone 7.1 — Auto-summary**
- From the meeting's Markdown notes, suggest a short summary — review-before-save, same as every M5 result
- Uses M5's provider interface and its bounded refine loop; no new AI plumbing

**Milestone 7.2 — Suggested decisions and action items**
- Suggest decisions and action items extracted from the notes; the person reviews each one before it's added (never auto-created, matching the spec's "users review the suggestions before they become tasks")
- Suggestions that look like an action item but lack an owner or date are flagged, not silently guessed

**Milestone 7.3 — Audio** *(later, explicitly deferred by the spec)*
- Automatic audio recording and transcription into the meeting's transcript field
- Shares groundwork with **M9** (Voice): once STT is benchmarked there, meeting transcription reuses it rather than picking a second engine

---

## M8 — Focus & digital wellbeing *(outline)*

*Owner's feature 8. New; no existing code. Start with tracking, not intervention — the spec's own order.*

**Milestone 8.1 — Focus sessions**
- A focus timer, optionally linked to one task (so finishing a session can trigger M6's pet reaction)
- Local-first: sessions are just another local, deletable record, same shape as the existing usage data

**Milestone 8.2 — Summaries**
- Daily and weekly focus summaries, alongside the existing Time page rather than a separate page
- Optional personal goals (e.g. "3 focus sessions a day"); no accountability pressure, no streaks that punish a missed day

**Milestone 8.3 — Later, explicitly conditional**
- More invasive app-usage monitoring (blocking distracting apps, stricter enforcement) — the spec says "before considering" this, i.e. it needs its own owner decision once sessions alone prove useful, not a default to build toward

## M9 — Voice commands & dictation: Phase 6 *(outline; was M7)*

*Owner's feature 5. Reordered ahead of MCP per the owner's 2026-10-13 list — see the note under §2.*

**Milestone 9.1 — Benchmark first**
- Benchmark speech-to-text engines before committing to one: accuracy, latency, Indian English specifically (the owner's own requirement), and resource use (build principle 2: idle CPU <1%, RAM <100 MB — a local STT model is the risk here)
- Write up the comparison and pick one before any UI is built

**Milestone 9.2 — Capture & intent**
- Activation by push-to-talk button (no wake word, no always-on mic — matches build principle 2 and ordinary privacy expectations)
- Audio capture and intent parsing

**Milestone 9.3 — Actions**
- Voice → task, voice → note, voice queries ("what's on today"), spoken results
- Dictation into the note/task editor as an alternative to typing, not just discrete commands

**Milestone 9.4 — Meetings**
- Meeting transcription into the transcript field (M7.3), once this milestone's STT choice exists

## M10 — MCP connectors: Phase 5, 5.1 *(outline; was M6)*

*Owner's feature 6. The owner's own scope: start with one verified integration and a secure permission system, not all five at once.*

**Milestone 10.1 — Foundation**
- MCP client scaffold
- OAuth 2.0 + PKCE; tokens in the OS keychain (the same storage M5 needs for its API key — build it once, reuse it)
- Per-integration toggle in Settings; MCP events routed into Loaf's own event bus

**Milestone 10.2 — First connector, verified**
- One service, end to end, used for real before adding a second. GitHub or Google Calendar are the two the owner has mentioned by name; the choice is the owner's (it decides what "verified" tests against)
- Read-only to start: list/show, never write, until the permission system itself has been exercised

**Milestone 10.3 — More services (read-only)**
- Gmail (+ action-item extraction, which reuses M5/M7's extraction pattern), Google Calendar, Slack, Notion
- Today's agenda gains calendar events (already in the plan since 2026-10-04 — see DECISIONS.md)

### M10b — CI status: Phase 5.1 *(outline; was M6b)*
- GitHub Actions status (Jenkins if sizing allows)
- CI pass/fail pet reactions, reusing M6's reaction and quiet-hours plumbing
- CI-failure notification and a suggested task (reuses M7's "suggest, don't auto-create" rule)

---

## M11 — Privacy radar: the report *(outline; new)*

*Owner's feature 9. Detection rides with M3 (same browser integration); this milestone is the person-facing report.*

- Show what was detected — known third-party trackers, by domain, with the evidence (which site, which tracker, how many times) — never an unsupported claim about what data was collected, which the person's browser and Loaf cannot actually see
- Show uncertainty explicitly where it exists (a domain matching a known tracker list is not proof of what it does); the report reads like a researcher's note, not a verdict
- One place to act: don't track, delete, or see detail — reusing the existing per-domain settings from `tracking.exclude_apps`'s pattern

---

## M12 — Developer reactions: Phase 4 *(outline; was M5)*

*Fully offline, as originally planned. **Not on the owner's 2026-10-13 feature list** — kept here rather than deleted, since removing locked scope without being told isn't right either. Flagged in `DECISIONS.md` for the owner to confirm: still wanted, or drop it?*

**Milestone 12.1 — Git**
- Repository watcher on `.git` refs
- Commit and push detection

**Milestone 12.2 — Build**
- Local build monitoring
- Build state in the dashboard

**Milestone 12.3 — Reactions**
- Pet reactions to git and build events (reuses M6's reaction plumbing)
- Build-failure notification
- Suggest a task from a failure (reuses M7's "suggest, review, never auto-create" rule)

---

## M13 — Character customization: Phase 7 *(outline; was M8)*
*Pulled forward (owner, 2026-10-12): four character designs and the bear's typing pose exist as a preview; typing along is built for the bear (Unverified on a real OS); the other characters are not selectable yet.*

**Milestone 13.1 — Character system**
- Asset pipeline and lazy loading
- Character switching UI

**Milestone 13.2 — Wardrobe**
- Outfits and closet
- Seasonal packs

**Milestone 13.3 — Context**
- App-specific reactions
- Character pack download
